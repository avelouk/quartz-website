A library and a tool to create great looking paper miniatures for DnD and other tabletop RPGs. 

## How it started
I love playing Dungeons and Dragons and used to host sessions regularly back home, however about a year ago I moved to another continent and had to leave all the maps, minis and books behind with my friends who still play.
After the dust settled I started missing the DnD games and decided to host a one shot with some of the great people I've met in the past months. It was around the same time that custom GPTs were announced and I wondered if DALLE-3 got good enough to generate and print miniatures for the game. 
Spoiler alert: it did!

## The prototype
Long story short - after some tinkering with a [custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZwDQv0FEg-printable-minis), some editing and arts and crafts -here's what I got for the first session.

There is definitely a lot to improve but the one shot went great and I definitely enjoyed the hell out of the process. Shoutout to Caleb Hutchins for the awesome [one shot about the iron golem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165IcREKDpnx4dtxhgXRxlFaFOirtJqEWz52W-TmVeQ0/edit) (the most fun NPC to run).

## The Action plan
1. Create a concept
2. Validate the concept
3. Create the MVP
5. ???
6. Profit (or Pivot)
## The [[Concept - Paper minis|Concept]]
The next step is to try and turn this idea into a product and scrutinize the idea to really see if it has potential to bring value to people. Here is where my product management skill will come in handy. 

Here are the usual steps I use to turn an idea into a [[concept]]. When you go through these steps most ideas will start cracking and will fail to become [[viable]] concepts.
1. ***What is the result you can expect and wish to have?*** - Understand the [[high level goal]] for the business (in this case it's me and my goals with this product)
2. ***Who are we building this for?*** - Deeply understand the person who is going to buy and use the product and create a [[user persona]].
	1. Pro tip - a good first user is yourself (or your old self) whom you definitely know very well. And you better make sure you know your [[user persona]] intimately - spend time thinking about their hopes and dreams, what makes them happy or sad, what are their values, good and bad habits etc.
	2. Remember that the buyer and the user can be different people.
	3. Estimate how many people might be in your [[audience]] or [[niche]]. This is known as [[reach]].
3. ***What problem are we solving for this person?*** - This is known as [[value proposition]]. Notice that the [[audience]] comes first and then we define the problem
	1. Pro tip - solve a *single* specific problem. That way your [[MVP]] will have a very clear [[value proposition]] and you will avoid spending a ton of time and money to ship a product only to find out that nobody wants it and you need to [[pivot]].
4. ***How is this person solving the problem now?*** - Also known as [[competitor analysis]]. 
	1. You will often find that there is already a great solution in the market, and unless you can offer a significantly better deal go back to step 2 and find a new [[niche]] or a new [[value proposition]].
	2. Pro tip - often your biggest competitors are pen and paper or excel.
5. ***How will you put your product in front of this person?*** - This is your [[acquisition channel]].
	1. You can make the best thing since sliced bread, but if no one hears about it no one will use it.
6. ***What is the minimum number of steps to achieve your goal?*** - Also known as [[MVP]].
	1. You will never know for sure if the product works until you put it in front of users so your first version should be laser focused on delivering on the value proposition as fast as possible. 
7. ***How will you know if the product is successful?*** - You need to be honest and precise in measuring the success of your product.
	1. Defining the [[success metrics]] comes *before* launching a product and not after.

Let's apply this steps to "Paper minis" and see where it takes us. [[Concept - Paper minis]]
