A library and a tool to create great looking paper miniatures for DnD and other tabletop RPGs. 

### How it started
I love playing Dungeons and Dragons and used to host sessions regularly back home, however about a year ago I moved to another continent and had to leave all the maps, minis and books behind with my friends who still play.
After the dust settled I started missing the DnD games and decided to host a one shot with some of the great people I've met in the past months. It was around the same time that custom GPTs were announced and I wondered if DALLE-3 got good enough to generate and print miniatures for the game. 
Spoiler alert: it did!

### The prototype
Long story short - after some tinkering with the [custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZwDQv0FEg-printable-minis), some editing and arts and crafts -here's what I got for the first session.

There is definitely a lot to improve but the one shot went great. Shoutout to Caleb Hutchins for the awesome [one shot about the iron golem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165IcREKDpnx4dtxhgXRxlFaFOirtJqEWz52W-TmVeQ0/edit) (the most fun NPC to run)
