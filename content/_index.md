Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I am a Software Engineer who decided to become a Product Manager for some reason. I love technology and I believe that great tech should feel like magic. My goal is to use tech to it's full potential and have it bring convenience and delight to our daily lives.

Here I build products alone, document the process and share successes, failures, and learnings. 

## Current project - [[Paper minis]]
