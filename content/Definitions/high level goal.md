What do *you* specifically want out of this? The "you" here can be replaced with your boss, your stakeholders or the business. 
It's tempting to think that the goal is always to make money but, surprisingly, that's often not the case. When you think about it a little longer you realize that you want money to achieve some sort of purpose, others do too. A great business makes money and then uses most of that money as fuel to get to it's ultimate destination. Without a bigger vision and investing into the future your business will have a very short life.
